# CC-Fraud-Detection
Fraud detection in Credit Card Transactions:

Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. Out of 284,807 transactions, only 492 are fraudulent, making the dataset highly imbalanced. This imbalance presents a significant challenge, as it requires careful handling during data preprocessing and model building to ensure accurate detection of fraudulent activities.

Business Context
Credit card fraud is a critical issue for banks and financial institutions, leading to substantial financial losses and erosion of customer trust. According to the Nilson Report, banking fraud was projected to account for $30 billion in losses worldwide by 2020. With the rise of digital payment systems, fraudulent activities have become more sophisticated and prevalent.

For banks, detecting and preventing fraud is not just a competitive advantage but a necessity. Machine learning offers a proactive approach to identifying fraudulent transactions, reducing manual reviews, minimizing chargebacks, and preventing the denial of legitimate transactions. This project aims to leverage machine learning to build a robust fraud detection system that can address these challenges effectively.

**Dataset Overview**
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following key features:

Time: The number of seconds elapsed between the first transaction and the subsequent transactions.

Amount: The transaction amount.

V1-V28: Principal components obtained using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. These features are the result of transformations applied to the original data.

Class: The target variable, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate one.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of the total data. This imbalance necessitates specialized techniques during model training and evaluation.

Project Pipeline
The project follows a structured pipeline to ensure a thorough analysis and effective model building:

**1. Data Understanding**

Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Identify key variables and their distributions.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**
Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.
Check for skewness in the data and apply transformations if necessary.
Visualize the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.

**3. Data Preprocessing**

Handle the class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or synthetic data generation.

Normalize or standardize features if required.

Split the data into training and testing sets for model validation.

**5. Model Building**

Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.

**6. Model Evaluation**

Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC are used to assess model performance.

Focus on minimizing false negatives (fraudulent transactions incorrectly classified as legitimate) to align with business goals.

Validate the model using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.

**7. Deployment (Optional)**

Deploy the best-performing model as a fraud detection system.

Monitor the modelâ€™s performance in real time and retrain as needed.

Key Challenges

Class Imbalance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing a tiny fraction of the total data. This requires specialized techniques to ensure the model can accurately detect fraud.

Feature Confidentiality: The dataset features have been transformed using PCA, which limits interpretability but ensures data privacy.

Model Evaluation: Traditional accuracy metrics are insufficient for imbalanced datasets. Metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are more appropriate for evaluating fraud detection models.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn
